    "description": "Thirty-nine breast cancer cell lines were profiled by ELISA in the absence of stimulation to assess the abundance and phosphorylation state of 22 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as well as the abundance of 2 downstream kinases (Akt and ERK1/2) and of the intracellular receptors estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). These measurements serve as an indicator of the baseline activity state and activation potential of these cells in the context of several signaling pathways of relevance to breast cancer progression and therapeutic drug sensitivity.",

These measurements serve both as an indicator of the sensitivity of different cell lines to various stimuli and as a demonstration of the variable utilization of downstream signaling pathways in the different cell lines.",
